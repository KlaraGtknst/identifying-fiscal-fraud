This survey addresses the task of identifying fiscal fraud using anomaly detection techniques with regard to the problem governments' tax offices are facing in terms of tax evasion. As it is difficult to find profound studies of this specific problem, papers about a transferable problem are used to identify different approaches to face the original problem.
Multiple supervised methods to tackle credit card fraud are listed. 
The main focus of this survey is on unsupervised techniques. 
The four methods \acl{ARIMA}, \acl{IF}, \acl{AE}, and \acl{SOM} are described in more detail. 
This paper provides a discussion on how applicable each of these approaches is to the original problem, as well as a short outline of the approaches' shortcomings.
